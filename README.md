# SimpX

This projects aims to demonstrate how virtual machines, dynamic taint analysis, and symbolic execution engines work.

Instructions:
Running this platform should be relatively easy. Clone the project onto your local machine and move into the directory. Create an example source code file (at least one should be provided when checking out the project) and feed it into the program via the following command: 
	$ python SimpX.py <path/to/input/file.input>
More options will be added later.
